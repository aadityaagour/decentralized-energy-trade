Decentralised Energy Trade-The Aptos Marketplace contract is a smart contract on the Aptos blockchain that facilitates buying, selling, and managing digital assets. It handles asset listings, transactions, pricing, and security, ensuring smooth and secure marketplace operations.


EV-CHARGING-STATION
Developed a blockchain based Solution on the Ethereum platform, using a SMART CONTRACT, for Peer 2 Peer [P2P] Electrical Vehicle Charging and used a Security 2Go Starter kit R1 card to sign Blockchain Transactions.


BACKGROUND
ABC Power Corp wants develop a Blockchain based platform to enable Individual person having excess capability of Energy Generation to Install an Electric Vehicle [EV] Charging Station and start providing the charging services to EV Owners, by registering the new station to this platform. The necessary hardware for EV station will be taken care by ABC Power corp. EV Owners need to just register on this platform and start availing the services of registered EV Charging Stations and making the payment for Charging Services.

WHY BLOCKCHAIN
The peer-to-peer electricity trading mechanism requires a trusted entity to ensure the proper transactions. Blockchain is the trusted information system that allows users to create immutable time-stamped, transactions and settle payment automatically using smart contract, without human and third-party Intervention.
